## 🔹 Project Overview  
This project aimed to design a **cost-effective and structurally efficient** truss capable of supporting **96.24 oz** while staying under a **$300 cost constraint**. The final design successfully achieved this with a **$209.59 truss cost and a load-to-cost ratio of 0.459 oz/$**.

## 📌 How It Works  
1️⃣ **Truss Configuration & Design:**  
   - Evaluated **Warren, Pratt, and Howe trusses** for optimal load distribution.  
   - Designed an **asymmetrical truss** to accommodate constraints.  

2️⃣ **MATLAB Computational Analysis:**  
   - Calculated **forces in each member** under load.  
   - Identified **critical buckling members**.  
   - Optimized for **maximum load efficiency**.  

3️⃣ **Final Performance Metrics:**  
   - **Maximum Load:** **96.24 oz**  
   - **Truss Cost:** **$209.59**  
   - **Load-to-Cost Ratio:** **0.459 oz/$**
